### (b)
Compare result of different $\nu$

$\nu = 0.0$

![q3_b_0](./img/sir_model_0.0.png)

$\nu = 0.10$

![q3_b_1](./img/sir_model_0.1.png)

$\nu = 0.30$

By comparing the results of different $\nu$, we can find that when $\nu$ increases, the number of susceptible individuals decreases faster, and the number of recovered individuals increases faster. This is because the vaccination rate $\nu$ reduces the number of susceptible individuals by vaccinating them, and also reduces the number of infected individuals by reducing the contact rate.
